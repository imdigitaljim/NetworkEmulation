1. Compiled on linprog, using makefile, type "make"

2. Commands you can run in stations/bridges

	Stations/Routers:
	
	send <destination> <message> // send message to a destination host ie "send B howdy"
	show arp // show the ARP cache table information
	show host // show the IP/name mapping table
	connect // attempts to connect if the station has been disconnected
	debug // toggles debug on or off
	exit //exit the station

	Bridges:
	ttl // shows the MAC/ttl tables and connection list
	debug // toggles debug on or off
	exit //exit the bridge
	
3. To start the simulation using XTERM, type "run_simulation" (operates like the demo)

   which emulates the following network topology

   
          B              C                D
          |              |                |
         cs1-----R1------cs2------R2-----cs3
          |              |                |
          -------A--------                E

    cs1, cs2, and cs3 are bridges.
    R1 and R2 are routers.
    A to E are hosts/stations.
    Note that A is multi-homed, but it is not a router.
